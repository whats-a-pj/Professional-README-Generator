## Tests
If you run into errors using this, watch the walkthrough video in the assets folder. The walkthrough video is also linked in the repository README file.

Make sure you read the prompts carefully as the editor functionality is a little bit of a pain. Type 'i' when you first get into the editor
if it doesn't already let you start typing up your descriptions. Then you will want to press esc, type :wq, and press enter to save your input.
