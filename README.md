# Professional README Generator

## Why was this project created?
This project was created so that fellow web developers can create quality readme files for their repositories and applications. If a user wanted to clone this repo, they could even go in and change the terminal questions and the syntax in the backticks to make a totally different kind of markdown file!

## What this project has taught me
I learned how to use node.js and inquirer; also how to use template literals, if I hadn't done some research outside of class I would most likely still be lost on the subject. I realized that even if I feel stupid asking, the course I am enrolled in is super fast-paced so if I have a question, it's better to sound dumb than it is to BE DUMB and not ask at all.

Cloned starter code

Created my own repo with the code

Re-watched class recordings to get a better feel of how to accomplish this assignment

Created github issues to set up a 'plan' to tackle the assignment

Created a separate branch to push changes with, incase I royally messed everything up lol

Found the syntax to use for inputs, editors and checkboxes for inquirer

Focused heavily on the mini project on 8/14 because it related exactly to this assignment

Finally got the license badges to show up on the newly created README

Recorded walkthrough video and created assets folder to put the file into

I had help from TA's Jacek Hacking, CJ Sanders and Trever Oveson during office hours and during class while working on the mini project to figure out why my terminal answers weren't populating to my newly created README file. I was happy to find out I was on the right track though, just didn't know how to direct the data to the new file.

I also had a study group with Brian Whisler, Salvador Mejia and Diego Yavara on 8/13 just to refresh the first two classes of our Node.js module, throw ideas out of how we can solve this assignment and ask questions that might have been too daunting to ask during class
